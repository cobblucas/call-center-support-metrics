**File:** [`call-center-support-metrics.pbix`](https://github.com/cobblucas/call-center-support-metrics/blob/master/call-center-support-metrics.pbix)    
**Description:** This project employs visualizations, including AI-driven smart narratives, ribbon charts, and bar graphs, to offer insights into the evolution of call center support metrics over time. The dataset consolidates information from various sources, presenting coherent time-series data on call volume by priority. To examine customer types by year/month, users can utilize the slicers located towards the top of each page.

The analysis delves into wait times and insights across multiple pages, incorporating pie charts and tabular data matrices. These visual representations illustrate call volume, time to answer, handling time and answer rates.

Additionally, the project conducts a detailed examination of agents, distinguishing between answered calls versus call volume, with a specific emphasis on call volume by shift and showcases amount of calls by agent.

Lastly, the focus shifts to insights and trends, exploring call volume over time by department. The analysis also considers anomalies, time to answer and abandoned calls.
